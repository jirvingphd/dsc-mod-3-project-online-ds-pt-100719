       "### The Project\n",
       "\n",
       "For this project, you'll be working with the Northwind database--a free, open-source dataset created by Microsoft containing data from a fictional company. You probably remember the Northwind database from our section on Advanced SQL. Here's the schema for the Northwind database:\n",
       "\n",
       "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-mod-3-project/master/Northwind_ERD_updated.png'>\n",
       "\n",
       "The goal of this project is to test your ability to gather information from a real-world database and use your knowledge of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to generate analytical insights that can be of value to the company.\n",
       "\n",
       "## The Deliverables\n",
       "\n",
       "The goal of your project is to query the database to get the data needed to perform a statistical analysis.  In this statistical analysis, you'll need to perform a hypothesis test (or perhaps several) to answer the following question:\n",
       "\n",
       "**_Does discount amount have a statistically significant effect on the quantity of a product in an order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?_**\n",
       "\n",
       "In addition to answering this question with a hypothesis test, you will also need to come up with **_at least 3 other hypotheses to test on your own_**.  These can by anything that you think could be imporant information for the company.\n",
       "\n",
       "For this hypothesis, be sure to specify both the **_null hypothesis_** and the **_alternative hypothesis_** for your question.  You should also specify if this is one-tail or a two-tail test.\n",
       "\n",
       "For online students, there will be four deliverables for this project:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. A **_Jupyter Notebook_** containing any code you've written for this project. This work will need to be pushed to your GitHub repository in order to submit your project.\n",
       "2. An organized **README.md** file in the GitHub repository that describes the contents of the repository. This file should be the source of information for navigating through the repository.\n",
       "3. A **_[Blog Post](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-welcome-blogging)_**.\n",
       "4. An **_\"Executive Summary\" PowerPoint Presentation_** that explains the hypothesis tests you ran, your findings, and their relevance to company stakeholders.  \n",
       "\n",
       "Note: On-campus students may have different delivarables, please speak with your instructor. \n",

       "\n",
       "**_Organization/Code Cleanliness_**\n",
       "\n",
       "* The notebook should be well organized, easy to follow, and code is commented where appropriate.  \n",
       "<br>  \n",
       "    * Level Up: The notebook contains well-formatted, professional looking markdown cells explaining any substantial code. All functions have docstrings that act as professional-quality documentation.  \n",
       "<br>      \n",
       "* The notebook is written to technical audiences with a way to both understand your approach and reproduce your results. The target audience for this deliverable is other data scientists looking to validate your findings.  \n",
       "<br>    \n",
       "* Any SQL code written to source data should also be included.  \n",
       "\n",
       "**_Findings_**\n",
       "\n",
       "* Your notebook should clearly show how you arrived at your results for each hypothesis test, including how you calculated your p-values.   \n",
       "<br>\n",
       "* You should also include any other statistics that you find relevant to your analysis, such as effect size.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Blog Post Must-Haves\n",
       "\n",
       "Refer back to the [Blogging Guidelines](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-welcome-blogging) for the technical requirements and blog ideas.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### Executive Summary Must-Haves\n",
       "\n",
       "Your presentation should:\n",
       "\n",
       "* Contain between 5-10 professional quality slides detailing:\n",
       "<br>  \n",
       "    * A high-level overview of your methodology  \n",
       "    <br>  \n",
       "    * The results of your hypothesis tests  \n",
       "    <br>  \n",
       "    * Any real-world recommendations you would like to make based on your findings (ask yourself--why should the executive team care about what you found? How can your findings help the company?)  \n",
       "    <br>  \n",
       "* Take no more than 5 minutes to present  \n",
       "<br>  \n",
       "* Avoid technical jargon and explain results in a clear, actionable way for non-technical audiences.  \n",
